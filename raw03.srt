1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:10,339
One weekend Jobs was visiting Wayne at his apartment, engaging as they often did in philosophical discussions, when Wayne said that there was something he needed to tell him.

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:16,500
Yeah, I think I know what it is, Jobs replied.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Wayne said yes.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,380
It was my first encounter with someone who I knew was gay, Jobs recalled.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,660
He put Jobs grilled him.

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,059
When you see a beautiful woman, what do you feel?

7
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,060
Wayne replied, It's like when you look at a beautiful horse.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,979
You can appreciate it, but you don't want to sleep with it.

9
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,339
You appreciate beauty for what it is.

10
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:49,659
Wayne said that it is a testament to Jobs that he felt like revealing this to him.

11
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:56,619
Nobody at Atari knew, and I could count on my toes and fingers the number of people I told him my whole life.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:29,920
One reason Jobs was eager to make some money in early nineteen seventy four was that Robert Friedland, who had gone to India the summer before, was urging him to take his own spiritual journey there.i, who had been the guru to much of the sixties hippie movement.

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,680
Jobs decided he should do the same, and he recruited Daniel Kotki to go with him.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,219
Jobs was not motivated by mere adventure, but For me, it was a serious search, he said.

15
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:50,060
I'd been turned on to the idea of enlightenment, and trying to figure out who I was and how I fit into things.

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,139
Kotki adds that job Js asob goods as' quest seemed driven partly by not knowing his birth parents.

17
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:59,899
There was a hole in him, and he was trying to fill it.

18
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:08,299
When Jobs told the folks at Atari that he was quitting to go to thear in India, the jovial Alcorn was amused.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm going to find my guru and I say no shit.

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,200
That's super, write me.

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,560
And he says he wants me to help pay, and I tell him bullshit.

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,439
Then Alqucaorn had an idea.

23
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:35,080
Atari was making kits and shipping them to Munich, where they were built into Finnish machines and distributed by a wholesaler in Turin.

24
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,240
But there was no a problem.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:48,620
Because the games were designed for the American rate of sixty frames per second, There were frustrating interference problems in Europe where the rate was fifty frames per second.

26
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,580
Alcorn sketched out a fix with jobs and then offered to pay for him to go to Europe to implement it.

27
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,660
It's gotta be cheaper to get to India from there, he said.

28
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,180
Jobs agreed.

29
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,300
So Alcorn sent him on his way with the exhortation Say hi to your guru for it.

30
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:18,180
Job spent a few days in Munich, where he solved the interference problem, but in the process he flummox the dark suited German managers.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,099
They complained to Alcorn that he dressed and smelled very bum and behaved rudely.

32
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,420
I said, Did he solve the problem?

33
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,420
And they said yeah.

34
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,620
I said if you got any more problems, you just call me.

35
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,259
I got more problems guys just like him.

36
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,620
They said, No, no, we'll take care of it next time.

37
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,539
For his part, Jobs was upset that the Germans kept trying to feed him meat and potatoes.

38
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:51,899
They don't even have a word for vegetarian, he complained, incorrectly, in a phone call to Alcorn.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:03,340
He had a better time when he took the train to see the distributor in Turin, where the Italian pastas and his hosts camaraderie were more sympatico.

40
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,219
I had a wonderful couple of weeks in Turin, and the other thing that I've got to do.

41
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:16,939
The distributor took me every night to dinner at this place where there were only eight tables and no menu.

42
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,220
You just tell them what you wanted, and they made it.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,579
It was really super.

44
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:34,660
He next went to Lugano, Switzerland, where he stayed with Friedland's uncle, and from there took a flight to India.

45
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:46,339
When he got off the plane in New Delhi, he was felt waves of heat rising from the tarmac, even though it was only April.

46
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,019
So he went to one his taxi driver insisted was good.

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,280
Jobs asked the owner whether the water was filtered and foolishly believed the answer.

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,520
I got dysentery pretty fast.

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,040
I was sick, really sick, a really high fever.

50
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:19,460
I. dropped from a hundred eighty Once he got healthy enough to move, he decided that he needed to get out of Delhi.

51
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:31,060
So he headed to the town of Haridwar, in western India near the source of the Ganges, which was having a water festival known as the Kumba Mela.

52
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,580
More than ten million people poured into a town that usually contained fewer than one hundred thousand residents.

53
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,780
There were holy men all around, tents with this teacher and that teacher.

54
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,420
There were people riding elephants, you name it.

55
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,639
I was there for a few days, but I decided that I needed to get out of there too.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,399
He went by train and bus to a village near Nain Tal in the foothills of the Himalayas.

57
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,120
That was where Nim Karoli Baba lived or had lived.

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:18,519
By, but I think it the's a time J very good thing.obs got there With a mattress on the floor from a family who helped him recuperate by feeding him vegetarian meals.

59
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:34,399
There was a copy there of Autobiography of a Yogi in English that a previous traveler had left and I read it several times because there was not a lot to do, and I walked around from village to village and recovered from my dysentery.

60
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:47,839
Among those who were part of the community there was Larry B. Brilliant, an epidemiologist who was working to eradicate smallpox and later ran Google's philanthropic arm and the Skull Foundation.

61
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,959
Uh, I think that's a good He became Jobs of the idea.

62
00:06:51,899 --> 00:07:01,019
At one point Jobs was told of a young Hindu holy man who was holding a gathering of his followers at the Himalayan estate of a wealthy businessman.

63
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:08,139
It was a chance to meet a spiritual being and hang out with his followers, but it was also a chance to have a good meal.

64
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,539
I could smell the food as we got near, and I was very hungry.

65
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:21,899
As Jobs was eating, the holy man, who was not much older than Jobs, picked him out of the crowd, pointed at him, and began laughing maniacally.

66
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:30,719
He came running over and grabbed me and made a tooting sound and said You are just like a baby, recalled Jobs.

67
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,279
I was not relishing this attention.

68
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:46,560
Taking Jobs by the hand, heard the case.

69
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,519
I'm thinking he's a nutcase and begin to worry.

70
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,120
And he lathered up my hair and shaved my head.

71
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,080
Daniel Kotki arrived in India at the beginning of the summer, and Jobs went back to New Delhi to meet him.

72
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
They wandered mainly by bus rather aimlessly.

73
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:23,760
By this point Jobs was no longer trying to find a guru who could impart wisdom, but instead was seeking enlightenment through ascetic experience, deprivation, and simplicity.

74
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,480
He was not able to achieve innocent.

75
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,299
who Jobs alleged had been watering down the milk she was selling them.

76
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,860
Yet Jobs could also be generous.

77
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,899
When they got to the town of Manali, Kotki's sleeping bag was stolen with his travel bagers checks in it.

78
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,980
Steve covered my food expenses and bus ticket back to Delhi, Kotki recalled.

79
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:31,959
He also gave Kotki the rest of his own money that seven months in India, K He had written to his parents only sporadically, getting mail at the American Express office in New Delhi when he passed through, and so they were somewhat surprised when they got a call from the Oakland Airport asking them to pick him up.

80
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,079
So I'm sitting there, and my parents walked past me about five times, and I'm not sure.

81
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,139
Finally my mother came up and said Steve and I said Hi.

82
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,379
They took him back home where he continued trying to find himself.

83
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,459
It was a pursuit with many paths toward enlightenment.

84
00:09:53,459 --> 00:10:03,139
In the mornings and evenings he would meditate and study Zen, and in between he would drop in to audit physics or engineering courses at Stanford.

85
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:21,120
The search Jobs' interest in Eastern spirituality, Hinduism, Zen Buddhism, and the search for enlightenment was not merely the passing phase of the world.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,519
Years later, sitting in his Palo Alto garden, he reflected on the lasting influence of his trip to India.

87
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,440
Coming back to America was for me much more of a cultural shock than going to India.

88
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:04,720
The people in the Indian countryside don't use their intellect like we do, they use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world.

89
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,240
Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect in my opinion.

90
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,039
That's had a big impact on my work.

91
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,339
Western rational thought is not an innate human characteristic.

92
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,139
It is learned and is the great achievement of Western civilization.

93
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,500
In the villages of India, they never learned it.

94
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,819
They learned something else, which is in some ways just as valuable, but in other ways is not.

95
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:38,620
That's the power of intuition and experiential wisdom.

96
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:48,600
Coming back after seven months in Indian villages, I saw the craziness of the Western world as well as its capacity for rational thought.

97
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,799
If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless you are your mind is.

98
00:11:53,799 --> 00:12:04,279
If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there's room to hear more subtle things.

99
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,600
when your intuition starts to blossom, and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more.

100
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,480
Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment.

101
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,600
You see so much more than you could see before.

102
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,120
It's a discipline.

103
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,519
You have to practice it.

104
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,120
Zen has been a deep influence in my life ever since.

105
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,959
At one point I was thinking about going to Japan and trying to get into the Iji monastery, is a very good thing.

106
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:40,679
but my spiritual advice He said there is nothing over there that isn't here.

107
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,799
And he was correct.

108
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:51,639
I learned the truth of the Zen saying that if you are willing to travel around the world to meet a teacher, one will appear next door.

109
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,399
Jobs did in fact find a teacher right in his own neighborhood.

110
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:12,120
Shunru Suzuki, who wrote Zen Mind Beginner's Mind, and ran the San Francisco Zen Center, used to come to learn Los Altos every Wednesday evening to lecture and meditate with a small group of followers.

111
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,879
After a while he asked his assistant, Kobun Chino Otagawa to open a full time center there.

112
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:28,120
Jobs became a faithful follower, along with his occasional girlfriend Chris Ann Brennan and Daniel Kotki and Elizabeth Holmes.

113
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:37,420
He also began to go by himself on retreats to the Tasahara Zen Center, a monastery near Carmel, where Koban also taught.

114
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,159
Cocky found Coban amusing.

115
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,120
His English was atrocious, he recalled.

116
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,399
He would speak in a kind of haiku, with poetic, suggestive phrases.

117
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,759
We would sit and listen to him, and half the time we had no idea what he was going on about.

118
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,240
I took the whole thing as a kind of lighthearted interlude.

119
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,639
Holmes was more into the scene.

120
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:09,159
We would go together Coban's meditations, sit on Zafu cushions, and he would sit on a dais, she said.

121
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
We learned how to tune out distractions.

122
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
It was a magical thing.

123
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:24,879
One evening we were meditating with Cobin when it was raining, and he taught us how to use ambient sounds to bring us back to focus on our meditation.

124
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,639
As for Jobs, his devotion was intense.

125
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,000
He became really serious and self important and just generally unfortun unatebearable, according to Kotki.

126
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,180
I ended up spending as much time as I could with him, Jobs recalled.

127
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,700
He had a wife who was a nurse at Stanford and two kids.

128
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,180
She worked the night shift, so I would go over and hang out with him in the evenings.

129
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,259
She would do it get home about midnight and shoe me away.

130
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:06,540
They sometimes discussed whether Job should devote himself fully to spiritual pursuits, but Coben counseled otherwise.

131
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:16,659
He The relationship turned out to be lasting and deep.

132
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:21,859
Seventeen years later, Coben would perform Jobs' wedding ceremony.

133
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:35,779
Jobs' compulsive search for self awareness also led him to undergo perfectly primal scream therapy, which had recently been developed and popularized by a Los Angeles psychotherapist named Arthur Janov.

134
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:42,979
It was based on the Freudian theory that psychological problems are caused by the repressed pains of childhood.

135
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:53,219
Janoff argued that they could be resolved by re suffering these primal moments while fully expressing the pain, sometimes in screams.

136
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:05,019
To jobs, this seemed preferable to talk therapy because it involved intuitive feeling and emotional action rather than just rational analyzing.

137
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,019
This was not something to think about.

138
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:15,659
do, to close your eyes, hold your breath, jump in, and come out the other end more insightful.

139
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:31,919
A group of Janoff's adherents ran a program called the Oregon Feeling Center in an old hotel in Eugene that was managed by Jobs' Reed College Guru, Robert Friedland, whose all one farm commune was nearby.

140
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:40,000
In late nineteen seventy four, Jobs signed up for a twelve week course of therapy there costing one thousand dollars..

141
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:57,480
Stephen Holly Jobs confided to close friends that he was driven by the pain he was feeling about being put up for adoption and not knowing about his birth parents.

142
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:05,240
Steve had a very profound desire to know his physical parents and the case.

143
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:15,079
He had learned from Paul and Clara Jobs that his birth parents had both been graduate students at a university and that his father might be Syrian.

144
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,819
He had even thought about hiring a private investigator to But he decided not to do so for the time being.

145
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,700
I didn't want to hurt my parents, he recalled, referring to Paul and Clara.

146
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:42,620
He was struggling with the fact that he had been adopted, according to Elizabeth Holmes.

147
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,819
He was even more open with Greg Calhoun.

148
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:52,860
He was doing a lot of soul searching about being adopted, and he talked about it with me a lot, Calhoun recalled.

149
00:17:53,299 --> 00:18:02,019
The primal scream and the mucusless diets, he was trying to cleanse himself and get deeper into his frustration about his birth.

150
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,419
He told me he was deeply angry about the fact that he had been given up.

151
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:18,259
John Lennon had undergone the same primal scream therapy in nineteen seventy, and in December of that year he released the song Mother with the plastic Ono band.

152
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:25,779
It dealt with Lennon's own feelings about a fairly father who had abandoned him and a mother who had been killed when he was a teenager.

153
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:32,500
The refrain includes the haunting chant Mama don't go, Daddy come home.

154
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,940
Jobs used to play the song often.

155
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,259
Jobs later said that Janov's teachings did not prove very useful.

156
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:47,940
He offered a ready made, buttoned down answer, which turned out to be far too oversimplistic.

157
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,579
It became obvious that it was not going to yield any great insight.'s a very good thing.

158
00:18:52,579 --> 00:19:04,019
But Holmes contended that abrasive personality, but there was a peace about him for a while.

159
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:19,259
Jobs came to believe that he could impart that feeling of confidence to others and thus push them to do things they hadn't thought possible.

160
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:37,980
Holmes had broken up with Kotkey and joined a religious cult in San Francisco that expected her to sever ties with all past friends.

161
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,580
And she was to come.

162
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:57,299
Even more brazenly, he said she would have to drive part of the way, even though she didn't know how to use it was a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a Once we got on the open road, he made me get behind the wheel, and he shifted the car until we got up to fifty five miles per hour, she recalled.

163
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:04,259
Then he puts on a tape of Dylan's blood on the tracks and, lays his head in my lap, and goes to sleep.

164
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,380
He had the attitude that he could do anything, and therefore so can you.

165
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,860
He put his life in my hands and.

166
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,299
So that made me do something I didn't think I could do.

167
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,740
It was the brighter side of what would become known as his reality distortion field.

168
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,660
If you trust him, you can do things, Holmes said.

169
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,460
If he's decided that something should happen, a very good idea.

170
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:45,359
Breakout One day in early nineteen seventy five, Al Alcorn was sitting in his office at Atari when Ron Wayne burst in.

171
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,319
Hey, Stevie is back, he shouted.

172
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,919
Wow, bring him on in, Alcorn replied.

173
00:20:51,919 --> 00:21:02,559
Job shuffled in, barefoot, wearing a saffron robe, and carrying a copy of Be here now, which he handed to Alcorn and insisted he read.

174
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,079
He looked like a Hari Krishna guy, but it was great to see him, Alcorn recalled.

175
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,079
So I said sure.

176
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,119
Once again, for the sake of harmony, Jobs worked mostly at night.

177
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:25,879
Wozniak, who was living in an apartment nearby and working at HP, would come by after dinner to hang out and play the video games.

178
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:26,039
He able to do it.

179
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:46,679
had been One day in the late summer of nineteen seventy five-five, Nolan Bushnell, defying the prevailing wisdom that paddle games were over, decided to develop a single player version of Pong.

180
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:54,899
Instead of competing against an opponent, the player would volley the ball into a wall that lost a brick whenever it was hit.

181
00:21:54,899 --> 00:22:01,539
He called Jobs into his office, sketched it out on his little blackboard, and asked if he could him to design it.

182
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:07,859
There would be a bonus, Bushnell told him, for every chip fewer than fifty that he used.

183
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:16,740
Bushnell knew that Jobs was not a great engineer, but he assumed correctly that he would recruit Wozniak who was always hanging around.

184
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,199
I looked at it as a two for one thing, Bushnell recalled.

185
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,119
Waz was a better engineer.

186
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,759
Wozniak was thrilled when Jobs asked him to help and proposed splitting the fee.

187
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:36,480
This was the most wonderful offer in my life to actually design a game that people would use, he recalled.

188
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,080
Jobs said it had to be done in four days and with the fewest chips possible.

189
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:03,719
A game like this might take most engineers a few months, Wozniak recalled.

190
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:09,159
I thought there was no way I could do it, but Steve made me sure that I could.

191
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,799
So he stayed up four nights in a row.

192
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,839
and did it.

193
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,639
During the day at HP, Wozniak would sketch out his design on paper.

194
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:23,159
Then after a fast food meal, he would go right to Atari and stay all night.

195
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:31,959
As Wozniak churned out the design, Job sat on a bench to his left implementing it by wire wrapping the chips onto a breadboard.

196
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:43,460
While Steve was breadboarding, I spent time playing my favorite game ever, which was the auto racing game Grand Track ten, Wozniak said.

197
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:51,700
Astonishingly, they were able to play get the job done in four days, and Wozniak used only forty five chips.

198
00:23:51,700 --> 00:24:02,180
Recollections differ, but by most accounts Job simply gave Wozniak half of the base fee and not the bonus Bushnell paid for saving five chips.

199
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:13,480
It would be another ten years before Wozniak discovered that By being shown the tale in a book on the history of Atari titled Zap, that jobs had been paid this bonus.

200
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,000
I think that Steve needed the money, and he just didn't tell me the truth, Wozniak lay.

201
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,960
later said.

202
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,360
When he talks about it now, there are long pauses, and he admits that it causes him pain.

203
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,600
I wish he had just been honest.

204
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:36,759
If he had told me he needed the money, I think it's a very good idea.

205
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,560
To Wozniak it showed a fundamental difference in their characters.

206
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:49,640
Ethics always mattered to me, and I still don't understand why he would have gotten paid one thing and told me he'd gotten paid another, he said.

207
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,000
But you know, people are different.

208
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,039
When Jobs learned this story was published, he called Wozniak to deny it.

209
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:17,319
He told me that he didn't remember doing it, and that if he did something like that he would remember it, so he probably didn't do it.

210
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,120
he said.

211
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,759
I gave him half the money I ever got.

212
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,319
That's how I've always been with Waz.

213
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,840
I mean Waz stopped working in nineteen seventy eight.

214
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,400
He never did one ounce of work after nineteen seventy eight.

215
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,660
And yet he got exactly the same shares of apple stock that I did.

216
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:42,980
Is it possible that memories are muddled and that jobs did not in fact shortchange Wozniak?

217
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,099
There's a chance that my memory is all wrong and messed up, Wozniak told me.

218
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:57,219
But, after a while details of this one, the three hundred and fifty dollar check.

219
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:01,539
He confirmed his memory with Nolan Bushnell and Al Alcorn.

220
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:06,659
I remember talking about the bonus money to Waz, and he was upset, Bushnell said.

221
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,440
I said yes, there was a bonus for each chip they saved, and he just shook his head and then clucked his tongue.

222
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,359
Whatever the truth, Wozniak later insisted that it was not worth rehashing.

223
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:29,839
Jobs is a complex person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits that make him successful.

224
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:36,720
Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he points out, he also could never have built Apple.

225
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,319
I would rather let it pass, he said when I pressed the button.

226
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:40,880
point.

227
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,480
It's not something I want to judge Steve by.

228
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:50,339
The Atari experience helped shape Jobs' approach to business and design.

229
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:57,059
He appreciated the user friendliness of Atari's insert quarter avoid cling ons games..

230
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:09,139
That simplicity Jobs also absorbed some of Bushnell's take no prisoner's attitude.

231
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:16,980
Nolan wouldn't take no for an answer, according to Alcorn, and this was Steve's first impression of how things got done.

232
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,340
Nolan was never abusive like Steve sometimes is, but he had the same driven attitude.

233
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,819
It made me cringe, but damn it, it got things done.

234
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:31,940
In that way, Nolan was a mentor for jobs.

235
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Bushnell agreed.

236
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,200
There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that in Steve, he said.

237
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,480
He was interested not just in engineering, but also the business aspects.

238
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,960
I taught him that if you act like you can do something then it will work.

239
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,440
I told him pretend to be completely in control, and people will assume that you you are.

240
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:24,100
Chapter 5 The Apple One Turn on, Boot Up, Jack In Machines of Loving Grace In San Francisco and the Santa Clara Valley during the late nineteen sixties, various cultural currents flowed together.

241
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:36,740
There was the technology revolution that began with the growth of military consequences contractors and soon included electronics firms, microchip makers, and the case, and the other thing.

242
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:55,720
That included engineers who didn't conform to the HP mold and their kids who weren't attuned to the wavelengths of the subdivisions.

243
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,160
There were quasi academic groups doing studies of the on the effects of LSD.

244
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:20,200
Participants included Doug Engelbart of the Augmentation Research Center in Palo Alto, who later helped develop the computer mouse and graduate Graphical User Interfaces, and Ken Keasey, who celebrated the drug with music and light shows featuring a house band that became the Grateful Dead.

245
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,720
There was the hippie movement, born out of the Bay Area's beat generation, and the rebellious political activists, born out of the free speech movement at Berkeley.

246
00:29:31,720 --> 00:30:07,079
Overlaid on it all were veryment movements pursuing paths to personal enlightenment, Zen and Hinduism, meditation and yoga, primal scream and sound sensory deprivation, Esalin and Est This fusion of flower power and processor power is And dreamed of starting his own business.

247
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,039
There was just something going on here, he said, looking back at the time and place.

248
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,119
The best music came from here.

249
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:24,039
The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Joan Bobbyaez, Janice Joplin, and so did the Integrated Circuit, and things like the whole earth catalog.

250
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,240
Initially, the technologists and the hippies did not interface well.

251
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,880
Many in the counterculture saw computers as ominous and Orwellian, the province of the Pentagon and the power structure.

252
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:55,840
In the myth of the machine, the historian Lewis Mumford warned that computers were sucking away our freedom and destroying life enhancing value.

253
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,279
became an ironic phrase of the anti war left.

254
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,819
But by the early nineteen seventies a shift was underway.

255
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:21,460
Computing went from being dismissed as a tool of bureaucratic control to being embraced as a symbol of individual expression and liberation, John Markov wrote in his study of the counterculture's convergence with the computer industry.

256
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,259
What the Dormouse said it waste.

257
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:49,299
And the cyberdelic fusion was certified when Timothy Leary declared that personal computers had become the new LSD and years later revised his famous mantra to proclaim turn on, boot up, jack in.

258
00:31:50,700 --> 00:32:04,860
The musician Bono, who later became a friend of Jobs, often discussed with him why those immersed in the rock, drugs, rebel counterculture of the Bay Area ended up helping to create the personal companion.

259
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,200
The sixties produced an anarchic mindset that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence.

260
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:53,399
One person who encouraged the denizens of the counterculture to make common cause with the hackers was Stuart Brand, a puckish visionary who generated fun and ideas over many decades and, Brand was a participant in one of the early sixties LSD studies in Palo Alto.

261
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:05,000
He joined with his fellow subject, Ken Keyzy, to produce the acid celebrating Trips Festival, appeared in the opening scene of Tom Wolfe's The Electric Koolate Acid Test.

262
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:15,919
And worked with Doug Engelbart to create a seminal sound and light presentation of new technologies called the mother of all demos.

263
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:33,199
Most of our generation scorn computers as the embodiment of centralized control, Brand later noted, but a tiny contingent, later called hackers, embraced computers andir sent about a about transforming them into tools of liberation.

264
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Bran ran the Whole Earth Truckstore, which began as a roving truck that sold useful tools and educational materials, and in nineteen sixty-eight he decided to extend its reach with the Whole Earth Catalog.

265
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,079
On its first cover was the famous picture of Earth taken from space.

266
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,599
Its subtitle was Access to Tools.

267
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,880
The underlying philosophy was that technology could be our friend.

268
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,079
Brand wrote on the first page of the first edition A realm of intimate personal power is developing.

269
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:24,639
Power of the individual to conduct his own education, finally inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.

270
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,559
Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the whole earth catalog.

271
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:40,000
Buckminster Fuller followed with a poem that began I see God in the instruments and mechanisms of theory.

272
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Jobs became a whole earth fan.

273
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:55,880
He was particularly taken by the final issue which came out in nineteen seventy one when he was still in high school, and he brought it with him to college and then to the all one farm.

274
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:04,119
their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

275
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,639
Beneath it were the words stay hungry, stay foolish.

276
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,840
Brand sees jobs as one of the purest embodiments of the cultural mix that the catalog sought to celebrate.

277
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,200
Steve is right at the nexus of the counterculture and technology, he said.

278
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:37,580
Brand's catalog was published with the help of the Portola Institute, a foundation dedicated to the fledgling field of computer education.

279
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,019
The foundation also helped launch the People's Computer Company.

280
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:03,280
There were occasional Wednesday night potluck dinners, and two of the regulars, Gordon French and Fred Moore, decided to create a more formal club where news about personal electronics could be shared.

281
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:15,519
They were energized by the arrival of the january nineteen seventy five issue of Popular Mechanics, which had on its cover the first personal computer kit, the oldest thing.

282
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:24,559
The Altair wasn't much, just a four hundred ninety five dollar pile of parts that had to be soldered to a board that would then do little.

283
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,260
But for hobbyists and hackers, it heralded the dawn of a new era.

284
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:40,099
Bill Gates and Paul Allen read the magazine and started working on a version of BASIC, an easy to use programming language for the Altair.

285
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:11,380
The Home Brew Computer Club The group became known as the Homebrew Computer Club, and it encapsulated the whole earth fusion between the counterculture and technology.

286
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:23,460
It would become to the personal computer era something akin to what the technical Turks head coffee house was to the age of doctor Johnson, a place where ideas were exchanged and disseminated.

287
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,200
Are you building your own computer?

288
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Terminal?

289
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,680
TV, typewriter?

290
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,640
It asked.

291
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,240
If so, you might like to come to a gathering of people with like minded interests.

292
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,560
Well.

293
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,260
Allen Baum spotted the flyer on the HP Bulletin board and called Wozniak, who agreed to go with him.

294
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,019
That night turned out to be one of the most important nights of my life, Wozniak recalled.

295
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:06,019
About thirty other people showed up, spilling out of French's open garage door, and they took turns describing their interests.

296
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:18,820
Wozniak, who later admitted to being extremely nervous, said he liked video games, pay movies for hotels, scientific calculator design, and TV terminal design and the other thing.

297
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:40,679
As he thought about the microprocessor, a chip that had an entire central processing unit on it, he had an insight.

298
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,519
He had been designing a terminal with a keyboard and a monitor that would.

299
00:38:44,519 --> 00:39:03,239
cover It was an enduring idea.

300
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,200
Keyboard, screen, and computer all in one integrated personal package.

301
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,840
This whole vision of a personal computer just popped into my head, he said.

302
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:29,720
That night, I started to see it would later become known as the Apple I was going to be able to do.

303
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,240
But each of those cost almost more than my monthly rent.

304
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,139
So he looked for an alternative.

305
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:43,340
He found one in the Motorola sixty eight hundred, which a friend at HP was able to get for forty dollars apiece.

306
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:51,500
Then he discovered a chip made by MOS technol Teogychnologies that was electronically the same but cost only twenty dollars.

307
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,539
It would make his machine affordable, but it would carry a long term cost.

308
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:14,039
In the other things.tel's chips and After work each day, Wozniak would go home for a TV dinner and then return to HP to moonlight on his computer.

309
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:20,759
He spread out the parts in his cubicle, figured out their placement, and soldered them onto his motherboard.

310
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:41,019
I typed a few keys on the keyboard, and I was shocked.

311
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:44,539
The letters were displayed on the screen.

312
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:52,219
It was Sunday, june twenty ninth, nineteen seventy five, a milestone for the personal computer.

313
00:40:52,219 --> 00:41:03,900
It was the first time in history, Wozniak later said, anyone had typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer's screen right in front of them.

314
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,059
Jobs was impressed.

315
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:12,019
He peppered Wozniak with questions Could the computer ever be networked?

316
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:15,780
Was it possible to add a disk for memory storage?

317
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,139
He also began to help Wozniak components.

318
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:24,340
Particularly important were the dynamic random access memory chips.

319
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,900
Jobs made a few calls and was able to score some from Intel for free.

320
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,340
Steve is just that sort of person, said Wozniak.

321
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,840
I mean, he knew how to talk to a sales representative who I could never have done that.

322
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm too shy.

323
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:48,379
Jobs began to accompany Wozniak to home brew meetings, carrying the TV monitor and helping to set things up.

324
00:41:48,379 --> 00:42:01,419
The meetings now attracted more than one hundred enthusiasts and had been moved to the auditorium of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

325
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:09,579
was Lee Felsenstein, another embodiment of the merger between the world of computing and the counterculture.

326
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,139
He was an engineering school dropout.

327
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,119
Participant in the free speech movement and an anti war activist.

328
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,480
He had written for the alternative newspaper Berkeley Barb and then gone back to being a computer engineer.

329
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:34,800
While W heaz was was usually too shy to talk in the meetings, but people would gather around his machine afterward, and he would proudly show off his progress.

330
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,280
Moore had tried to instill the homebrew an ethos of swapping and sharing rather than commerce.

331
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,000
The theme of the club, Waz said, was give to help others.

332
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,139
It was an expression of the hacker ethic that information should be free and all authority mistrusted.

333
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:59,699
I designed the apple one because I wanted to give it away for free to other people, said Wozniak.

334
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:03,840
Well This was not an outlook that Bill Gates embraced.

335
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:25,840
After he and Paul Allen had completed their basic interpreter for the Altair, Gates was appalled that members of the home brew were making copies of it and sharing it without paying him.

336
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,360
Is this fair?

337
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:35,299
You can afford to do professional work for nothing.

338
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:39,380
I would appreciate letters from anyone who wants to pay up.

339
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:50,059
Steve Jobs similarly did not embrace the notion that Wozniak's creations, be it a blue box or a computer, wanted to be free.

340
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:55,019
So he convinced Wozniak to stop giving away copies of his schematics.

341
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:59,419
Most people didn't have time to build it themselves anyway, Jobs argued.

342
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:03,500
Why don't we build and sell printed circuit boards to them?

343
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,859
It was an example of their symbiosis.

344
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:13,019
Every time I'd design something great, Steve would find a way to make money for us, said Wozniak.

345
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,420
Wozniak admitted that he would have never thought of doing that on his own.

346
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,619
It never crossed my mind to sell computers.

347
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:26,579
It was Steve who said let's hold them in the air and sell a few.

348
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:35,420
Jobs worked out a plan to pay a guy he knew at Atari to draw the circuit boards and then print up fifty or so.

349
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,820
That would cost about one thousand dollars plus the fee to the designer.

350
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:46,300
They could sell the them for forty dollars apiece and perhaps clear a profit of seven hundred dollars.

351
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,579
Wozniak was dubious that they could sell them all.

352
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:53,019
I didn't see how we would make our money back.

353
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:59,740
He was already in trouble with his landlord for bouncing checks, and now had to pay each month in cash.

354
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,860
Jobs knew how to appeal to Wozniak.

355
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:10,420
He didn't argue that they were sure to make money, but instead that they would have a fun adventure.

356
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:17,700
Even if we lose our money, we'll have a company., said Jobs as they were driving in his Volkswagen bus.

357
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,940
For once in our lives we'll have a company.

358
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:27,300
This was enticing to Wozniak, even more than any prospect of getting rich.

359
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,900
He recalled, I was excited to think about us like that.

360
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:34,300
Be two best friends starting a company.

361
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,019
Wow.

362
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:37,500
I knew right then that I'd do it.

363
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,860
How could I not?

364
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:51,399
In order to raise the money they needed, Wozniak sold his HP sixty five calculator for five hundred dollars, though the buyer ended up stiffing him for half of that.

365
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:51,639
Forted.

366
00:45:51,639 --> 00:46:18,340
his part, Jobs was and a plan.

367
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,460
They would start their own computer company.

368
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,380
Apple is born.

369
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,920
Now that they had decided to start a business they needed a name.

370
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:42,000
Jobs had gone for another visit to the all one farm, where he had been pruning the Gravenstein apple trees, and Wosniak picked him up at the airport.

371
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,880
On the ride down to Los Altos, they bandied around options.

372
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:59,840
They considered some typical tech words, such as matrix and some neologism execute, and some straightforward boring names like personal computers ink.

373
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:06,379
The deadline for deciding was the next day when Jobs wanted to start filing the papers.

374
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:09,899
Finally, Jobs proposed Apple Computer.

375
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:13,500
I was on one of my fruitarian diets, he explained, and.

376
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,059
I had just come back from the apple farm.

377
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:19,980
It sounded fun, spirited, and not intimidating.

378
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,939
Apple took the edge off the word computer.

379
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:26,460
Plus it would get us ahead of a time Atari in the phone book.

380
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,779
He told Wozniak that if a better name did not hit them by the next afternoon, they would just stick with Apple.

381
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,480
And they did.

382
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,599
Apple.

383
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,599
It was a smart choice.

384
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,000
The word instantly signaled friendliness and simplicity.

385
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It managed to be both slightly offbeat and as normal as a slice of pie.

386
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,280
There was a whiff of counterculture, back to nature earthiness to it, yet nothing could be more American.

387
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,840
And the two words together Apple computer provided an amusing disjuncture.

388
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:12,819
It doesn't quite make sense, said Mike Markla, who soon thereafter became the first chairman of the new company, and So it forces your brain to dwell on it.

389
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:16,019
Apple and computers, that doesn't go together.

390
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:19,380
So it helped us grow brand awareness.

391
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,380
Wosniak was not yet ready to commit full time.

392
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:30,260
He was an HP company man at heart, or so he thought, and he wanted to keep his day job there.

393
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:37,940
Jobs realized he needed an ally to help him corral Wozniak and adjudicate if there was a disagreement.

394
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:46,420
So he enlisted his friend Ron Wayne, the middle aged engineer at Atari, who had once started a slop.

395
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:52,659
Wayne knew that it would not be easy to make Wozniak quit HP, nor was it necessary right away.

396
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:00,599
Instead the key was to convince him that his computer designs would be owned by the Apple partnership.

397
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:10,680
Waz had a parental attitude toward the circuits he developed, and he wanted to be able to use them, Wayne said.

398
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,240
Jobs and I realized that these circuits would be the core of Apple.

399
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:22,680
We spent two hours in a round of the table discussion at my apartment, and I was able to get Waz to accept this.

400
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,920
His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer.

401
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,380
And this required him to commit his designs to the partnership.

402
00:49:33,380 --> 00:50:06,359
Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a ten percent stake in the new partnership, turning him into a tie.breaker Jobs had a bravado that helped him get things done, occasionally by manipulating people.

403
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:12,119
He could be charismatic, even mesmerizing, but also cold and brutal.

404
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:19,799
Wosoznianniak in contrast was shy and socially awkward, which made him seem childishly sweet.

405
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:24,359
Waz is very bright in some areas, but he's almost like a savant.

406
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,559
Since he was so stunted when it came to dealing with people he didn't know, said Jobs.

407
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,000
We were a good pair.

408
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:40,579
It helped that Jobs was awed by Wozniak's engineering wizardry, and Wozniak was awed by Jobs' business drive.

409
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:49,859
I never wanted to deal with people and step on toes, but I was Steve could call up people he didn't know and make them do things, Wozniak recalled.

410
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:13,160
Even after Wozniak became convinced that his new computer design should become the property of the Apple partnership, he felt that he had to offer it first to HP since he was working there.

411
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,079
I believed it was my duty to tell HP about what I had designed while working for them.

412
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,360
That was the right thing and the ethical thing.

413
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,920
So he demonstrated it to his managers in the spring of nineteen seventy six.

414
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:36,119
But he finally said it was not something that HP could develop.

415
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:43,719
It was a hobbyist product, at least for now, and didn't fit into the company's high quality market segments.

416
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:50,679
I was disappointed., Wozniak recalled, but now I was free to enter into the Apple partnership.

417
00:51:52,099 --> 00:52:01,059
On april first, nineteen seventy six, Jobs and Wozniak went to Wayne's apartment in Mountain View to draw up the partnership agreement.

418
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:10,659
Wayne said he had some experience writing in legalese, so he composed the three page document himself.

419
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:13,860
Paragraphs began with various flourishes.

420
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,059
Be it noted here with the water.

421
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,679
But the division of shares and profits was clear.

422
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:42,079
forty five percent, forty five percent, ten percent, and it was stipulated that any expenditures of more than one hundred dollars would result would require agreement of at least two of the partners.

423
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,039
Also the responsibilities were spelled out.

424
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:52,159
Wozniak shall assume both general and major responsibility for the comments conduct of electrical engineering.

425
00:52:52,159 --> 00:53:04,559
Jobs shall assume general responsibility for electrical engineering and marketing and Wayne shall assume major responsibility for mechanical engineering and documentation.

426
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:12,320
Jobs signed in lowercase script, Wozniak in careful cursive, and Wayne in an illegible squiggle.

427
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,659
Wayne then got cold feet.

428
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:22,380
As Jobs started planning to borrow and spend more money, he recalled the failure of his own company.

429
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,780
He didn't want to go through that again.ces.

430
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:36,539
Jobs and Wasniandddon kept gold coins hidden in his mattress.

431
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:44,860
Because they had structured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation, the partners would be personally liable for the debts.

432
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,820
And Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go after him.

433
00:53:49,820 --> 00:54:00,219
So he returned to the Santa Clara County office just eleven days later with a statement of withdrawal and an amendment to the police partnership agreement.

434
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:12,139
By virtue of a reassessment of understandings by and between all parties, it began, Wayne shall hereinafter cease to find function in the status of partner.

435
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:22,860
It noted that in payment for his ten percent of the company, the He received eight hundred dollars, and shortly afterward fifteen hundred dollars more.

436
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:33,420
Had he stayed on and kept his ten percent stake, at the end of two thousand ten, it would have been worth a hundred dollars approximately two point six billion dollars.

437
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:43,500
Instead, he was then living alone in a small home in Pa Rump, Nevada, where he played the penny slot machineines and lived off his social security check.

438
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,960
I made the best decision for me at the time.

439
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,720
Both of them were real whirlwinds, and I knew my stomach, and it wasn't ready for such a ride.

440
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:07,219
Jobs and Wozniak took the stage together for a presentation to the homebrew computer club shortly after they signed Apple into existence.

441
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:17,860
Wozniak held up one of their newly produced circuit boards and described the microprocessor, the eight kilobytes of memory, and the version of BASIC he had written.

442
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:31,359
Then it was Jobs' turn.

443
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:37,919
He pointed out that the apple, unlike the Altair, had all the essential components built in.

444
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:45,199
Then he challenged them with a question how much would people be able to willing to pay for such a wonderful machine?

445
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,199
He was trying to get them to see the amazing value of the apple.

446
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:56,000
It was a rhetorical flourish he would use at product presentations over the ensuing decades.

447
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,820
The Apple had a cut rate microprocessor, not the Intel eighty eighty.

448
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,580
But one important person stayed behind to hear more.

449
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:20,019
His name was Paul Terrell, and in nineteen seventy one five he had opened a computer store, which he dubbed the Bite Shop on Camino Real in Menlo Park.

450
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:25,940
Now a year later, he had three stores and visions of building a national chain.

451
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,900
Jobs was thrilled to give him a private demo.

452
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,580
Take a look at this, he said.

453
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,420
You're going to like what you see.

454
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,700
Terrell was impressed enough to hand Jobs and Waz his card.

455
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,260
Keep in touch, he said.

456
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:51,620
I'm keeping in touch, Jobs announced the next day when he walked barefooted into the bite shop.

457
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,220
But there was a condition.

458
00:56:53,220 --> 00:57:01,220
He didn't want just fifty dollar printed circuit boards, for which customers would then have to buy all the chips and do the assembly.

459
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,100
That might appeal to a few hardcore hobbyists.

460
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:06,779
But not to most customers.

461
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:10,139
Instead he wanted the boards to be fully assembled.

462
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:16,460
For that he was willing to pay about five hundred dollars apiece cash on delivery.

463
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,219
Jobs immediately called Wozniak at HP.

464
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:21,819
Are you sitting down?

465
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:22,539
he asked.

466
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,539
Wozniak said he wasn't.

467
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:27,579
Jobs nevertheless proceeded to give him the news.

468
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:31,819
I was shocked, Wozniak recalled.

469
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:34,219
I will never forget that moment.

470
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:40,740
To fill the order, they needed about fifteen thousand dollars worth of parts.

471
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:48,340
Alan Baum, the third prankster from Homestead High, and his father agreed to loan them five thousand dollars.

472
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:56,340
Jobs tried to borrow more from a bank in Los Altos, but the manager looked at him and not surprisingly declined.

473
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:02,580
He went to Hall Tech Supply and offered an interview equity stake in Apple in return for the parts.

474
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:08,340
But the owner decided they were a couple of young, scruffy looking guys, and declined.

475
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,440
Alcorn at Atari would sell them chips only if they paid cash up front.

476
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:26,599
Finally, Jobs was able to convince the manager of Kramer Electronics to call Paul Terrell to confirm that he had really committed to a twenty five thousand dollars order.

477
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:32,360
Terrell was at a conference when he heard over a loudspeaker that he had an emergency call.

478
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,599
Job.s had been persistent.

479
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:40,760
The Kramer manager told him that two scruffy kids had just walked in waving an order from the bite shop.

480
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,619
Was it real?

481
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:50,779
Tarot confirmed that it was, and the store agreed to front jobs the parts on thirty day credit.

482
00:58:52,859 --> 00:59:07,740
Garage Band The Jobs house in Los Altos became the assembly point for the fifty Apple one boards that had to be delivered to the bite shop within thirty days when the payment for the parts would come due.

483
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:22,059
All available for theak, plus Daniel Kotki, his ex girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes, who had broken away from the cult she had joined, and Jobs in the' pregnant sister, Patty.

484
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:28,220
Her vacated bedroom, as well as the kitchen table and garage, were commandeered as workspace.

485
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,960
Holmes, who had taken jewelry classes, was given the task of soldering chips.

486
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,839
Most I did well, but I got flucks on a few of them, she recalled.

487
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,439
This didn't please Jobs.

488
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:46,480
Well We don't have a chip to spare, he railed, correctly.

489
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,559
He shifted her to bookkeeping and paperwork at the kitchen table, and he did the soldering himself.

490
00:59:52,559 --> 01:00:03,700
When the he said.

491
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,260
If it did, I put it in a box.

492
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,980
If it didn't, I'd figure what pin hadn't gotten into the socket right.

493
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:19,260
Paul Job suspended his sideline of repairing old cars so that the Apple team could have the whole garage.

494
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:30,539
He put in a long old workbench, hung a schematic of the computer on the new plaster boardboard wall he built, and set up rows of labeled drawers for the components.

495
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:39,340
He also built a burn box bathed in heat lamps so the computer boards could be tested by the running overnight at high temperatures.

496
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:48,159
When there was the occasional eruption of temper, an occurrence not uncommon around his sun, Paul would impart some of his calm.

497
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:49,360
What's the matter?

498
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,079
he would say.

499
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,719
You got a feather up your ass?

500
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,960
In return, he occasionally asked to borrow back the TV set,.

501
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:17,440
which was the only one in the house to piles of parts and house guests, but she was frustrated by her son's increasingly quirky diets.

502
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:22,900
She would roll her eyes at his latest eating obsessions, recalled Holmes.

503
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:34,179
She just wanted him to be healthy, and he would be making weird pronouncements like I'm a fruitarian, and I will only eat little things.

504
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:42,219
After a dozen assembled boards had been approved by Wozniak, Jobs drove them over to the bite shop.

505
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:44,699
Terrell was a bit taken aback.

506
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:49,579
There was no power supply, case, monitor, or keyboard.

507
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,380
He had expected something more finished.

508
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:57,420
But jobs stared him down, and he agreed to take delivery and pay.

509
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,539
After thirty days Apple was on the verge of being profitable.

510
01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:09,100
We were able to build the boards more cheaply than we thought, because I got a good deal on parts, Jobs recalled.

511
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:16,460
So the fifty we sold to the bike shipite shop almost paid for all the material we needed to make a hundred boards.

512
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:22,220
Now they could make a real profit by selling the remaining fifty to their friends and home brooks.

513
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:37,380
Driving down from San Francisco once a week and figuring out how to port Jobs' checkbook into a ledger.

514
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:45,139
In order to seem like a real company, Jobs hired an answering service which would relate to rela they messages to his mother.

515
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:57,299
Ron Wayne drew a logo, using the ornate line drawing style of Victorian illustrated fiction that featured Newton sitting under the side under a tree framed by a quote from Wordsworth.
