1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,299
I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology.

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,980
Shakespeare, Plato, I loved King Lear.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,320
His other favorites included Moby Dick and the poems of Dylan Thomas.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:27,540
I asked him why he related to King Lear and Captain Ahab, two of the most willful and driven characters in literature, but he didn't respond to the connection I was making, so I let it drop.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,800
When I was a senior, I had this phenomenal AP English class.

6
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,740
The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway.

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,719
He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite.

8
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,140
One course the jobs took would become part of Silicon Valley lore.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:55,959
The electronics class taught by John McCollum, a former Navy pilot who had a showman's flair for exciting his students with such tricks as firing up a Tesla coil.

10
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:04,959
His little stock room, to which he would lend the key to pet students, was crammed with transistors and other components he had scored.

11
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:15,959
McCollum's classroom was in a shed-like building on the edge of the campus next to the parking lot, This is where it was, Jobs recalled as he peered in the window.

12
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,039
And here, next door, is where the auto shop class used to be.

13
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:26,019
The juxtaposition highlighted the shift from the interests of his father's generation.

14
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:31,539
Mr. McCollum felt that electronics class was the new auto shop.

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,290
McCollum believed in military discipline and respect for authority.

16
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,950
Jobs didn't.

17
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:51,010
His aversion to authority was something he no longer tried to hide, and he affected an attitude that combined wiry and weird intensity with aloof rebelliousness.

18
00:01:51,010 --> 00:02:01,320
McCollum later said, he was usually off in a corner doing something on his own and really didn't want to have much of anything to do with either me or the rest of the class.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,400
He never trusted jobs with a key to the stockroom.

20
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:17,340
One day Jobs needed a part that was not available, so he made a collect call to the manufacturer, Burroughs in Detroit, and said he was designing a new product and wanted to test out the part.

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,540
It arrived by air freight a few days later.

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,819
When McCollum asked how he had gotten it, Jobs described with defiant pride the collect call and the tale he had told.

23
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,000
I was furious, McCollum said.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,640
That was not the way I wanted my students to behave.

25
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,419
Job's response was, I don't have the money for the phone call.

26
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,079
They've got plenty of money.

27
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,319
Jobs took McCollum's class for only one year, rather than the three that it was offered.

28
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:59,680
For one of his projects, he made a device with a photo cell that would switch on a circuit when exposed to light, something any high school science student could have done.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,479
He was far more interested in playing with lasers, something he learned from his father.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,099
With a few friends, he created light shows for parties by bouncing lasers off mirrors on the speakers of his stereo system.

31
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:26,780
CHAPTER TWO Odd Couple THE TWO STEVES Waz.

32
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:38,879
While a student in McCollum's class, Jobs became friends with a graduate who was the teacher's all-time favorite and a school legend for his wizardry in the class.

33
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:49,719
Stephen Wozniak, whose younger brother had been on a swim team with Jobs, was almost five years older than Jobs and far more knowledgeable about electronics.

34
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,019
But emotionally and socially, he was still a high school geek.

35
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,560
Like Jobs, Wozniak learned a lot at his father's knee.

36
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,680
But their lessons were different.

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:09,140
Paul Jobs was a high school dropout who, when fixing up cars, knew how to turn a tidy profit by striking the right deal on parts.

38
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:21,720
Francis Wozniak, known as Jerry, was a brilliant engineering graduate from Caltech, where he had quarterbacked the football team, who became a rocket scientist at Lockheed.

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,019
He exalted engineering and looked down on those in business, marketing, and sales.

40
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:36,900
I remember him telling me that engineering was the highest level of importance you could reach in the world, Steve Wozniak later recalled.

41
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,960
It takes society to a new level.

42
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:53,210
One of Steve Wozniak's first memories was going to his father's workplace on a weekend and being shown electronic parts, with his dad putting them on a table with me so I got to play with them.

43
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:04,260
He watched with fascination as his father tried to get a waveform line on a video screen to stay flat so he could show that one of his circuit designs was working properly.

44
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,920
I could see that whatever my dad was doing, it was important and good.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,320
Woz, as he was known even then, would ask about the resistors and transistors lying around the house.

46
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,259
his father would pull out a blackboard to illustrate what they did.

47
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:27,539
He would explain what a resistor was by going all the way back to atoms and electrons.

48
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:36,000
He explained how resistors worked when I was in second grade, not by equations, but by having me picture it.

49
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:44,740
Was his father taught him something else that became ingrained in his childlike, socially awkward personality?

50
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,519
Never lie.

51
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,939
My dad believed in honesty, extreme honesty.

52
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:53,000
That's the biggest thing he taught me.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,720
I never lie, even to this day.

54
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,279
The only partial exception was in the service of a good practical joke.

55
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,000
In addition, he imbued his son with an aversion to extreme ambition.

56
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,899
which set Waz apart from Jobs.

57
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:18,519
At an Apple product launch event in 2010, 40 years after they met, Woz reflected on their differences.

58
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,859
My father told me, you always want to be in the middle, he said.

59
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:28,000
I didn't want to be up with the high-level people like Steve.

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,799
My dad was an engineer, and that's what I wanted to be.

61
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:35,939
I was way too shy ever to be a business leader like Steve.

62
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,860
By fourth grade, Wozniak became, as he put it, one of the electronics kids.

63
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:55,320
He had an easier time making eye contact with a transistor than with a girl, and he developed the chunky and stooped look of a guy who spends most of his time hunched over circuit boards.

64
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:14,759
At the same age when Jobs was puzzling over a carbon microphone that his dad couldn't explain, Wozniak was using transistors to build an intercom system featuring amplifiers, relays, lights, and buzzers that connected the kids' bedrooms of six houses in the neighborhood.

65
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:26,779
And at an age when Jobs was building Heath kits, Wozniak was assembling a transmitter and receiver from Halicrafters, the most sophisticated radios available.

66
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:39,359
Waugh spent a lot of time at home reading his father's electronics journals, and he became enthralled by stories about new computers, such as the powerful ENIAC.

67
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:47,219
Because Boolean algebra came naturally to him, he marveled at how simple rather than complex the computers were.

68
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:58,279
In eighth grade, he built a calculator that included 100 transistors, 200 diodes, and 200 resistors on 10 circuit boards.

69
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:06,540
It won top prize in a local contest run by the Air Force, even though the competitors included students through 12th grade.

70
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:17,599
Woz became more of a loner when the boys his age began going out with girls and partying, endeavors that he found far more complex than designing circuits.

71
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,199
Where before I was popular and riding bikes and everything, suddenly I was socially shut out, he recalled.

72
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,139
It seemed like nobody spoke to me for the longest time.

73
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,840
He found an outlet by playing juvenile pranks.

74
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:43,779
In twelfth grade, he built an electronic metronome, one of those tick-tick-tick devices that keep time in music class, and realized it sounded like a bomb.

75
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:50,440
So he took the labels off some big batteries, taped them together, and put it in a school locker.

76
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,360
He rigged it to start ticking faster when the locker opened.

77
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Later that day, he got called to the principal's office.

78
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,059
He thought it was because he had won yet again the school's top math prize.

79
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,120
Instead, he was confronted by the police.

80
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:17,200
The principal had been summoned when the device was found, Bravely ran onto the football field, clutching it to his chest, and pulled the wires off.

81
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,060
Woz tried and failed to suppress his laughter.

82
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,519
He actually got sent to the juvenile detention center, where he spent the night.

83
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,840
It was a memorable experience.

84
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:38,340
He taught the other prisoners how to disconnect the wires leading to the ceiling fans and connect them to the bars so people got shocked when touching them.

85
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:42,600
Getting shocked was a badge of honor for Woz.

86
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,519
He prided himself on being a hardware engineer, which meant that random shocks were routine.

87
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,980
He once devised a roulette game where four people put their thumbs in a slot.

88
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,299
When the ball landed, one would get shocked.

89
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:04,379
Hardware guys will play this game, but software guys are too chicken, he noted.

90
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:12,659
During his senior year, he got a part-time job at Sylvania and had the chance to work on a computer for the first time.

91
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:21,980
He learned Fortran from a book and read the manuals for most of the systems of the day, starting with the digital equipment PDP-8.

92
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:29,000
Then he studied the specs for the latest microchips and tried to redesign the computers using these newer parts.

93
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,700
The challenge, he set himself, was to replicate the design using the fewest components possible.

94
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,980
Each night he would try to improve his drawing from the night before.

95
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,460
By the end of his senior year, he had become a master.

96
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,879
I was now designing computers with half the number of chips the actual company had in their own design, but only on paper.

97
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,240
He never told his friends.

98
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,160
After all, most seventeen-year-olds were getting their kicks in other ways.

99
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,220
On Thanksgiving weekend of his senior year, Wozniak visited the University of Colorado.

100
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,399
It was closed for the holiday, but he found an engineering student who took him on a tour of the labs.

101
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,840
He begged his father to let him go there, even though the out-of-state tuition was more than the family could easily afford.

102
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,740
They struck a deal.

103
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,879
He would be allowed to go for one year, but then he would transfer to De Anza Community College back home.

104
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:45,779
After arriving at Colorado in the fall of 1969, he spent so much time playing pranks, such as producing reams of printouts saying, Fuck Nixon, that he failed a couple of his courses and was put on probation.

105
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:56,220
In addition, he created a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers that burned up so much computer time the university threatened to bill him for the cost.

106
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:02,319
So he readily lived up to his bargain with his parents and transferred to De Anza.

107
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,379
After a pleasant year at De Anza, Wozniak took time off to make some money.

108
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:16,639
He found work at a company that made computers for the California Motor Vehicle Department, and a co-worker made him a wonderful offer.

109
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,399
He would provide some spare chips so Wozniak could make one of the computers he had been sketching on paper.

110
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:33,860
Wozniak decided to use as few chips as possible, both as a personal challenge and because he did not want to take advantage of his colleague's largesse.

111
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:42,100
Much of the work was done in the garage of a friend just around the corner, Bill Fernandez, who was still at Homestead High.

112
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:54,519
To lubricate their efforts, they drank large amounts of Cragmont cream soda, riding their bikes to the Sunnyvale Safeway to return the bottles, collect the deposits, and buy more.

113
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,139
That's how we started referring to it as the cream soda computer, Wozniak recalled.

114
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:10,159
It was basically a calculator capable of multiplying numbers entered by a set of switches and displaying the results in binary code with little lights.

115
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,520
When it was finished, Fernandez told Wozniak there was someone at Homestead High he should meet.

116
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,540
His name is Steve.

117
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,560
He likes to do pranks like you do, and he's also into building electronics like you are.

118
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:33,800
It may have been the most significant meeting in a Silicon Valley garage since Hewlett went into Packard's 32 years earlier.

119
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:46,700
Steve and I just sat on the sidewalk in front of Bill's house for the longest time, just sharing stories, mostly about pranks we'd pulled, and also what kind of electronic designs we'd done.

120
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,299
Wozniak recalled.

121
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,620
We had so much in common.

122
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:59,379
Typically, it was really hard for me to explain to people what kind of design stuff I worked on, but Steve got it right away, and I liked him.

123
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,839
He was kind of skinny and wiry and full of energy.

124
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,799
Jobs was also impressed.

125
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:14,079
Woz was the first person I'd met who knew more electronics than I did, he once said, stretching his own expertise.

126
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,659
I liked him right away.

127
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:22,979
I was a little more mature than my years, and he was a little less mature than his, so it evened out.

128
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,559
Woz was very bright, but emotionally he was my age.

129
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,799
In addition to their interest in computers, they shared a passion for music.

130
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,159
It was an incredible time for music, Jobs recalled.

131
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,480
It was like living at a time when Beethoven and Mozart were alive.

132
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,100
Really, people will look back on it that way.

133
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,819
And Woz and I were deeply into it.

134
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:54,840
In particular, Wozniak turned Jobs onto the glories of Bob Dylan.

135
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,849
We tracked down this guy in Santa Cruz who put out this newsletter on Dillon, Bob said.

136
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:12,719
Dylan taped all of his concerts, and some of the people around him were not scrupulous, because soon there were tapes all around, bootlegs of everything, and this guy had them all.

137
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,399
Hunting down Dylan tapes soon became a joint venture.

138
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,639
The two of us would go tramping through San Jose and Berkeley and ask about Dylan bootlegs and collect them, said Wozniak.

139
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,779
We'd buy brochures of Dylan lyrics and stay up late interpreting them.

140
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,719
Dylan's words struck chords of creative thinking.

141
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:44,000
Added Jobs, I had more than a hundred hours, including every concert on the 65 and 66 tour, the one where Dylan went electric.

142
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,659
Both of them bought high-end TEAC reel-to-reel tape decks.

143
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:54,980
I would use mine at a low speed to record many concerts on one tape, said Wozniak.

144
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,899
Jobs matched his obsession.

145
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:06,360
Instead of big speakers, I bought a pair of awesome headphones and would just lie in my bed and listen to that stuff for hours.

146
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,020
Jobs had formed a club at Homestead High to put on music and light shows and also play pranks.

147
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,259
They once glued a gold-painted toilet seat onto a flower planter.

148
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,940
It was called the Buck Fry Club, a play on the name of the principal.

149
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:37,400
Even though they had already graduated, Wozniak and his friend Alan Baum joined forces with Jobs at the end of his junior year to produce a farewell gesture for the departing seniors.

150
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,879
Showing off the homestead campus four decades later, Jobs paused at the scene of the escapade and pointed.

151
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,559
See that balcony?

152
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,360
That's where we did the banner prank that sealed our friendship.

153
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:59,740
On a big bedsheet Baum had tie-dyed with the school's green and white colors, they painted a huge hand flipping the middle finger salute.

154
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:07,920
Baum's nice Jewish mother even helped them draw it and showed them how to do the shading and shadows to make it look more real.

155
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,200
I know what that is, she snickered.

156
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:23,019
They devised a system of ropes and pulleys so that it could be dramatically lowered as the graduating class marched past the balcony, and they signed it, Swab Job.

157
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:28,580
The initials of Wozniak and Baum combined with part of Job's name.

158
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:35,259
The prank became part of school lore and got Job suspended one more time.

159
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:41,960
Another prank involved a pocket device Wozniak built that could emit TV signals.

160
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:51,700
He would take it to a room where a group of people were watching TV, such as in a dorm, and secretly press the button so that the screen would get fuzzy with static.

161
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,879
When someone got up and whacked the set, Wozniak would let go of the button and the picture would clear up.

162
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:04,379
Once he had the unsuspecting viewers hopping up and down at his will, he would make things harder.

163
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:09,500
He would keep the picture fuzzy until someone touched the antennae.

164
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:16,980
Eventually, he would make people think they had to hold the antenna while standing on one foot or touching the top of the set.

165
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:27,400
Years later, at a keynote presentation where he was having his own trouble getting a video to work, Jobs broke from his script and recounted the fun they had with the device.

166
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:36,720
Woz would have it in his pocket, and we'd go into a dorm where a bunch of folks would be like watching Star Trek, and he'd screw up the TV.

167
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,019
and someone would go up to fix it and just as they had the foot off the ground he would turn it back on.

168
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,660
and as they put their foot back on the ground, he'd screw it up again.

169
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:56,519
Contorting himself into a pretzel on stage, Jobs concluded to great laughter, and within five minutes, he would have someone like this.

170
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,459
the blue box.

171
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:16,480
The ultimate combination of pranks and electronics and the escapade that helped to create Apple was launched one Sunday afternoon when Wozniak read an article in Esquire that his mother had left for him on the kitchen table.

172
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,919
It was September 1971, and he was about to drive off the next day to Berkeley, his third college.

173
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:41,079
The story, Ron Rosenbaum's Secrets of the Little Blue Box, described how hackers and phone freakers had found ways to make long-distance calls for free by replicating the tones that routed signals on the AT&T network.

174
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:50,259
Halfway through the article, I had to call my best friend Steve Jobs and read parts of this long article to him, Wozniak recalled.

175
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:57,659
He knew that Jobs, then beginning his senior year, was one of the few people who would share his excitement.

176
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:21,900
A hero of the piece was John Draper, a hacker known as Captain Crunch, because he had discovered that the sound emitted by the toy whistle that came with the breakfast cereal was the same 2600 hertz tone used by the phone network's call routing switches— It could fool the system into allowing a long-distance call to go through without extra charges.

177
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:35,380
The article revealed that other tones that serve to route calls could be found in an issue of the Bell System Technical Journal, which AT&T immediately began asking libraries to pull from their shelves.

178
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:45,340
As soon as Jobs got the call from Wozniak that Sunday afternoon, he knew they would have to get their hands on the technical journal right away.

179
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:56,500
Woz picked me up a few minutes later, and we went to the library at SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, to see if we could find it, Jobs recounted.

180
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,920
It was Sunday, and the library was closed, but they knew how to get in through a door that was rarely locked.

181
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,220
I remember that we were furiously digging through the stacks, and it was Woz who finally found the journal with all the frequencies.

182
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,340
It was like holy shit, and we opened it.

183
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,500
And there it was.

184
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,720
We kept saying to ourselves, it's real.

185
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
Holy shit, it's real.

186
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,740
It was all laid out.

187
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,440
The tones, the frequencies.

188
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:32,039
Wozniak went to Sunnyvale Electronics before it closed that evening and bought the parts to make an analog tone generator.

189
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:40,900
Jobs had built a frequency counter when he was part of the HP Explorers Club, and they used it to calibrate the desired tones.

190
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,940
With a dial, they could replicate and tape record the sounds specified in the article.

191
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,840
By midnight, they were ready to test it.

192
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:58,160
Unfortunately, the oscillators they used were not quite stable enough to replicate the right chirps to fool the phone company.

193
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,160
We could see the instability using Steve's frequency counter, recalled Wozniak, and we just couldn't make it work.

194
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:13,440
I had to leave for Berkeley the next morning, so we decided I would work on building a digital version once I got there.

195
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:21,400
No one had ever created a digital version of a blue box, but Waz was made for the challenge.

196
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:32,319
Using diodes and transistors from Radio Shack, and with the help of a music student in his dorm who had perfect pitch, he got it built before Thanksgiving.

197
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,559
I have never designed a circuit I was prouder of, he said.

198
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,620
I still think it was incredible.

199
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,880
One night, Wozniak drove down from Berkeley to Jobs' house to try it.

200
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,580
They attempted to call Wozniak's uncle in Los Angeles, but they got a wrong number.

201
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,140
It didn't matter.

202
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,840
Their device had worked.

203
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,000
Hi!

204
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,960
We're calling you for free!

205
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,700
We're calling you for free!

206
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,140
Wozniak shouted.

207
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,880
The person on the other end was confused and annoyed.

208
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
Jobs chimed in.

209
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
We're calling from California.

210
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,240
From California!

211
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,680
With a blue box!

212
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,039
This probably baffled the man even more since he was also in California.

213
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:19,660
At first, the blue box was used for fun and pranks.

214
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:28,299
The most daring of these was when they called the Vatican, and Wozniak pretended to be Henry Kissinger wanting to speak to the Pope.

215
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:37,139
We are at the summit meeting in Moscow, and we need to talk to the Pope, Woz intoned.

216
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:41,879
He was told that it was 5.30 a.m., and the Pope was sleeping.

217
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:46,519
When he called back, he got a bishop who was supposed to serve as a translator.

218
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,700
but they never actually got the Pope on the line.

219
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,200
They realized that Woz wasn't Henry Kissinger, Jobs recalled.

220
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,399
We were at a public phone booth.

221
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:04,000
It was then that they reached an important milestone, one that would establish a pattern in their partnerships.

222
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,440
Jobs came up with the idea that the blue box could be more than merely a hobby.

223
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,880
They could build and sell them.

224
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:24,240
I got together the rest of the components, like the casing and power supply and keypads, and figured out how we could price it, Jobs said, foreshadowing roles he would play when they founded Apple.

225
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:34,960
The finished product was about the size of two decks of playing cards, The parts cost about $40, and Jobs decided they should sell it for $150.

226
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,879
Following the lead of other phone freaks such as Captain Crunch, they gave themselves handles.

227
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:46,059
Wozniak became Berkeley Blue.

228
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,619
Jobs was oaf to bark.

229
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:54,920
They took the device to college dorms and gave demonstrations by attaching it to a phone and speaker.

230
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:02,680
While the potential customers watched, they would call the Ritz in London or a dial-a-joke service in Australia.

231
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,460
We made a hundred or so blue boxes and sold almost all of them, Jobs recalled.

232
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:13,660
The fun and profits came to an end at a Sunnyvale pizza parlor.

233
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,360
Jobs and Wozniak were about to drive to Berkeley with a blue box they had just finished making.

234
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,700
Jobs needed money and was eager to sell, so he pitched the device to some guys at the next table.

235
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,940
They were interested, so Jobs went to a phone booth and demonstrated it with a call to Chicago.

236
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,420
The prospects said they had to go to their car for money.

237
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:44,880
So we walk over to the car, Waz and me, and I've got the blue box in my hand, and the guy gets in, reaches under the seat, and he pulls out a gun.

238
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,539
Jobs recounted.

239
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,619
He had never been that close to a gun, and he was terrified.

240
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:56,339
So he's pointing the gun right at my stomach, and he says, Hand it over, brother.

241
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,539
My mind raced.

242
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:08,859
There was the car door here, and I thought maybe I could slam it on his legs and we could run, but there was this high probability that he would shoot me.

243
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:13,259
So I slowly handed it to him, very carefully.

244
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,160
It was a weird sort of robbery.

245
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,880
The guy who took the blue box actually gave Jobs a phone number and said he would try to pay for it if it worked.

246
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,560
When Jobs later called the number, the guy told him he couldn't figure out how to use it.

247
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,620
So Jobs, in his felicitous way, convinced the guy to meet him and Wozniak at a public place.

248
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:44,840
But they ended up deciding not to have another encounter with the gunman, even on the off chance they could get their $150.

249
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,279
The partnership paved the way for what would be a bigger adventure together.

250
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,460
If it hadn't been for the blue boxes, there wouldn't have been an apple, Jobs later reflected.

251
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,339
I'm a hundred percent sure of that.

252
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:09,079
Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.

253
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:17,519
They had created a device with a little circuit board that could control billions of dollars worth of infrastructure.

254
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,539
You cannot believe how much confidence that gave us.

255
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,359
Waz came to the same conclusion.

256
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:32,879
It was probably a bad idea selling them, but it gave us a taste of what we could do with my engineering skills and his vision.

257
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,780
The Blue Box Adventure established a template for a partnership that would soon be born.

258
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:54,900
Wozniak would be the gentle wizard coming up with a neat invention that he would have been happy just to give away, and Jobs would figure out how to make it user-friendly, put it together in a package, market it, and make a few bucks.

259
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,460
Chapter 3 The Dropout Turn on.

260
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,799
Tune in.

261
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Chris-Ann Brennan.

262
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:21,799
Toward the end of his senior year at Homestead in the spring of 1972, Jobs started going out with a girl named Chris-Ann Brennan, who was about his age but still a junior.

263
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:29,740
With her light brown hair, green eyes, high cheekbones, and fragile aura, she was very attractive.

264
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,119
She was also enduring the breakup of her parents' marriage, which made her vulnerable.

265
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:43,279
We worked together on an animated movie, then started going out, and she became my first real girlfriend, Jobs recalled.

266
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:47,319
As Brennan later said, Steve was kind of crazy.

267
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,839
That's why I was attracted to him.

268
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,400
Job's craziness was of the cultivated sort.

269
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:04,360
He had begun his lifelong experiments with compulsive diets, eating only fruits and vegetables, so he was as lean and tight as a whippet.

270
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:13,540
He learned to stare at people without blinking, and he perfected long silences punctuated by staccato bursts of fast talking.

271
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:24,020
This odd mix of intensity and aloofness, combined with his shoulder-length hair and scraggly beard, gave him the aura of a crazed shaman.

272
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,940
He oscillated between charismatic and creepy.

273
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,040
He shuffled around and looked half mad, recalled Brennan.

274
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,960
He had a lot of angst.

275
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,420
It was like a big darkness around him.

276
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:44,960
Jobs had begun to drop acid by then, and he turned Brennan on to it as well, in a wheat field just outside of Sunnyvale.

277
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
It was great, he recalled.

278
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,120
I had been listening to a lot of Bach.

279
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,080
All of a sudden, the wheat field was playing Bach.

280
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,260
It was the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point.

281
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,379
I felt like the conductor of this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat.

282
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:09,519
That summer of 1972, after his graduation, he and Brennan moved to a cabin in the hills above Los Altos.

283
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,419
I'm going to live in a cabin with Chris Ann, he announced to his parents one day.

284
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,439
His father was furious.

285
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,659
No, you're not, he said, over my dead body.

286
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:25,819
They had recently fought about marijuana, and once again the younger Jobs was willful.

287
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,899
He just said goodbye and walked out.

288
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,840
Brennan spent a lot of her time that summer painting.

289
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,420
She was talented, and she did a picture of a clown for Jobs that he kept on the wall.

290
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,660
Jobs wrote poetry and played guitar.

291
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:49,740
He could be brutally cold and rude to her at times, but he was also entrancing and able to impose his will.

292
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,260
He was an enlightened being who was cruel, she recalled.

293
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,400
That's a strange combination.

294
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,100
Midway through the summer, Jobs was almost killed when his red Fiat caught fire.

295
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:17,520
He was driving on Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains with a high school friend, Tim Brown, who looked back, saw flames coming from the engine, and casually said to Jobs, Pull over, your car's on fire.

296
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,300
Jobs did.

297
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,820
His father, despite their arguments, drove out to the hills to tow the Fiat home.

298
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:34,660
In order to find a way to make money for a new car, Jobs got Wozniak to drive him to De Anza College to look on the help-wanted bulletin board.

299
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:43,619
They discovered that the Westgate Shopping Center in San Jose was seeking college students who could dress up in costumes and amuse the kids.

300
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:55,139
So for three dollars an hour, Jobs, Wozniak, and Brennan donned heavy, full-body costumes and headgear to play Alice in Wonderland, the Mad Hatter, and the White Rabbit.

301
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,599
Wozniak, in his earnest and sweet way, found it fun.

302
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,760
I said, I want to do it.

303
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,540
It's my chance, because I love children.

304
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:10,640
I think Steve looked at it as a lousy job, but I looked at it as a fun adventure.

305
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,319
Jobs did indeed find it a pain.

306
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:21,079
It was hot, the costumes were heavy, and after a while I felt like I wanted to smack some of the kids.

307
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,460
Patience was never one of his virtues.

308
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,500
Read College.

309
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,779
Seventeen years earlier, Jobs' parents had made a pledge when they adopted him.

310
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,799
He would go to college.

311
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:46,200
So they had worked hard and saved dutifully for his college fund, which was modest but adequate by the time he graduated.

312
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,779
But Jobs, becoming ever more willful, did not make it easy.

313
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,060
At first he toyed with not going to college at all.

314
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:05,500
I think I might have headed to New York if I didn't go to college, he recalled, musing on how different his world, and perhaps all of ours, might have been if he had chosen that path.

315
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:11,799
When his parents pushed him to go to college, he responded in a passive-aggressive way.

316
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:19,640
He did not consider state schools, such as Berkeley, where Waz then was, despite the fact that they were more affordable.

317
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,500
Nor did he look at Stanford, just up the road and likely to offer a scholarship.

318
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,319
The kids who went to Stanford, they already knew what they wanted to do, he said.

319
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,079
They weren't really artistic.

320
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,700
I wanted something that was more artistic and interesting.

321
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:46,319
Instead, he insisted on applying only to Reed College, a private liberal arts school in Portland, Oregon, that was one of the most expensive in the nation.

322
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:55,720
He was visiting Waz at Berkeley when his father called to say an acceptance letter had arrived from Reed, and he tried to talk Steve out of going there.

323
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,199
So did his mother.

324
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,279
It was far more than they could afford, they said.

325
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,379
But their son responded with an ultimatum.

326
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,199
If he couldn't go to read, he wouldn't go anywhere.

327
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,880
They relented as usual.

328
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,980
Reed had only 1,000 students, half the number at Homestead High.

329
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:25,660
It was known for its free-spirited hippie lifestyle, which combined somewhat uneasily with its rigorous academic standards and core curriculum.

330
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:50,099
Five years earlier, Timothy Leary, the guru of psychedelic enlightenment, had sat cross-legged at the Reed College Commons while on his League for Spiritual Discovery, LSD, college tour, during which he exhorted his listeners, Like every great religion of the past, we seek to find the divinity within.

331
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,619
These ancient goals we define in the metaphor of the present.

332
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,360
Turn on, tune in, drop out.

333
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,900
Many of Reed's students took all three of those injunctions seriously.

334
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,519
The dropout rate during the 1970s was more than one-third.

335
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,679
When it came time for Jobs to matriculate in the fall of 1972, his parents drove him up to Portland.

336
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,179
But in another small act of rebellion, he refused to let them come on campus.

337
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:26,840
In fact, he refrained from even saying goodbye or thanks.

338
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,860
He recounted the moment later with uncharacteristic regret.

339
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,140
It's one of the things in life I really feel ashamed about.

340
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,619
I was not very sensitive, and I hurt their feelings.

341
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:39,420
I shouldn't have.

342
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,780
They had done so much to make sure I could go there, but I just didn't want them around.

343
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,559
I didn't want anyone to know I had parents.

344
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:58,059
I wanted to be like an orphan who had bummed around the country on trains and just arrived out of nowhere, with no roots, no connections, no background.

345
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,940
In late 1972, there was a fundamental shift happening in American campus life.

346
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,619
The nation's involvement in the Vietnam War and the draft that accompanied it was winding down.

347
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:22,460
Political activism at colleges receded, and in many late-night dorm conversations was replaced by an interest in pathways to personal fulfillment.

348
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:39,879
Jobs found himself deeply influenced by a variety of books on spirituality and enlightenment, Most notably, Be Here Now, a guide to meditation and the wonders of psychedelic drugs by Baba Ram Dass, born Richard Alpert.

349
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:43,099
It was profound, Jobs said.

350
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:46,059
It transformed me and many of my friends.

351
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:59,860
The closest of those friends was another wispy-bearded freshman named Daniel Kotke, who met Jobs a week after they arrived at Reed and shared his interest in Zen, Dylan, and acid.

352
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:10,980
Kotke, from a wealthy New York suburb, was smart but low-octane, with a sweet flower-child demeanor made even mellower by his interest in Buddhism.

353
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:21,079
That spiritual quest had caused him to eschew material possessions, but he was nonetheless impressed by Job's tape deck.

354
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:27,819
Steve had a TEAC reel-to-reel in massive quantities of Dylan bootlegs, Kotke recalled.

355
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:31,400
He was both really cool and high-tech.

356
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:47,260
Job started spending much of his time with Kotki and his girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes, even after he insulted her at their first meeting by grilling her about how much money it would take to get her to have sex with another man.

357
00:37:47,260 --> 00:38:02,260
They hitchhiked to the coast together, engaged in the typical dorm raps about the meaning of life, attended the love festivals at the local Hare Krishna temple, and went to the Zen center for free vegetarian meals.

358
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,360
It was a lot of fun, said Kotki, but also philosophical, and we took Zen very seriously.

359
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:29,820
Jobs began sharing with Kotki other books, including Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki, Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, and Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Chogyam Trongpa.

360
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:44,119
They created a meditation room in the attic crawlspace above Elizabeth Holmes's room and fixed it up with Indian prints, a doery rug, candles, incense, and meditation cushions.

361
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,309
There was a hatch in the ceiling leading to an attic which had a huge amount of space, Jobs said.

362
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:55,340
We took psychedelic drugs there sometimes, but mainly we just meditated.

363
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:04,650
Jobs' engagement with Eastern spirituality, and especially Zen Buddhism, was not just some passing fancy or youthful dabbling.

364
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:10,420
He embraced it with his typical intensity, and it became deeply ingrained in his personality.

365
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,380
Steve is very much Zen, said Kotke.

366
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,099
It was a deep influence.

367
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,819
You see it in his whole approach of stark, minimalist aesthetics, intense focus.

368
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:28,699
Jobs also became deeply influenced by the emphasis that Buddhism places on intuition.

369
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:41,000
I began to realize that an intuitive understanding in consciousness was more significant than abstract thinking and intellectual logical analysis, he later said.

370
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:46,659
His intensity, however, made it difficult for him to achieve inner peace.

371
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:54,100
His Zen awareness was not accompanied by an excess of calm, peace of mind, or interpersonal mellowness.

372
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:04,639
He and Kotke enjoyed playing a 19th century German variant of chess called Kriegspiel, in which the players sit back to back.

373
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,460
Each has his own board and pieces and cannot see those of his opponent.

374
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:19,699
A moderator informs them if a move they want to make is legal or illegal, and they have to try to figure out where their opponent's pieces are.

375
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:29,179
The wildest game I played with them was during a lashing rainstorm sitting by the fireside, recalled Holmes, who served as moderator.

376
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,840
They were tripping on acid.

377
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,360
They were moving so fast I could barely keep up with them.

378
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Another book that deeply influenced Jobs during his freshman year was Diet for a Small Planet by Francis Moore Lappe, which extolled the personal and planetary benefits of vegetarianism.

379
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,640
That's when I swore off meat pretty much for good, he recalled.

380
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:07,799
But the book also reinforced his tendency to embrace extreme diets, which included purges, fasts, or eating only one or two foods, such as carrots or apples, for weeks on end.

381
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,940
Jobs and Kotki became serious vegetarians during their freshman year.

382
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,820
Steve got into it even more than I did, said Kotki.

383
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,660
He was living off Roman meal cereal.

384
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:29,140
They would go shopping at a farmer's co-op where Jobs would buy a box of cereal, which would last a week, and other bulk health food.

385
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:38,640
He would buy flats of dates and almonds and lots of carrots, and he got a champion juicer, and we'd make carrot juice and carrot salads.

386
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,920
There is a story about Steve turning orange from eating so many carrots, and there is some truth to that.

387
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:52,200
Friends remember him having, at times, a sunset-like orange hue.

388
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:06,940
Job's dietary habits became even more obsessive when he read Mucusless Diet Healing System by Arnold Ehret, an early 20th century German-born nutrition fanatic.

389
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:21,019
He believed in eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables, which he said prevented the body from forming harmful mucus, and he advocated cleansing the body regularly through prolonged fasts.

390
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:27,440
That meant the end of even Roman meal cereal, or any bread, grains, or milk.

391
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,900
Jobs began warning friends of the mucus dangers lurking in their bagels.

392
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,099
I got into it in my typical nutso way, he said.

393
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:46,699
At one point he and Kotki went for an entire week eating only apples, and then Jobs began to try even purer fasts.

394
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:56,320
He started with two-day fasts and eventually tried to stretch them to a week or more, breaking them carefully with large amounts of water and leafy vegetables.

395
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:00,480
After a week, you start to feel fantastic, he said.

396
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,239
get a ton of vitality from not having to digest all this food.

397
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,269
I was in great shape.

398
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:10,919
I felt I could get up and walk to San Francisco anytime I wanted.

399
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:29,059
vegetarianism and Zen Buddhism, meditation and spirituality, acid and rock, jobs rolled together in an amped-up way, the multiple impulses that were hallmarks of the enlightenment-seeking campus subculture of the era.

400
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:41,419
And even though he barely indulged it at Reed, there was still an undercurrent of electronic geekiness in his soul that would someday combine surprisingly well with the rest of the mix.

401
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:53,679
Robert Friedland In order to raise some cash one day, Jobs decided to sell his IBM Selectric typewriter.

402
00:43:53,679 --> 00:44:00,929
He walked into the room of the student who had offered to buy it, only to discover that he was having sex with his girlfriend.

403
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:06,019
Jobs started to leave, but the student invited him to take a seat and wait while they finished.

404
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:30,239
I thought, this is kind of far out, Jobs later recalled, and thus began his relationship with Robert Friedland, one of the few people in Jobs's life "'who were able to mesmerize him.' He adopted some of Friedland's charismatic traits and for a few years treated him almost like a guru, until he began to see him as a charlatan.

405
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,139
Friedland was four years older than Jobs, but still an undergraduate.

406
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:45,039
The son of an Auschwitz survivor who became a prosperous Chicago architect, he had originally gone to Bowdoin, a liberal arts college in Maine.

407
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:53,360
But while a sophomore, he was arrested for possession of 24,000 tablets of LSD worth $125,000.

408
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:01,319
The local newspaper pictured him with shoulder-length, wavy, blonde hair, smiling at the photographers as he was led away.

409
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:08,319
He was sentenced to two years at a federal prison in Virginia, from which he was paroled in 1972.

410
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:19,380
That fall, he headed off to Reed, where he immediately ran for student body president, saying that he needed to clear his name from the miscarriage of justice he had suffered.

411
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,599
He won.

412
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:32,559
Friedland had heard Baba Ram Dass, the author of Be Here Now, give a speech in Boston, and like Jobs and Kotki, had gotten deeply into Eastern spirituality.

413
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:45,599
During the summer of 1973, he traveled to India to meet Ram Dass's Hindu guru, Neem Karoli Baba, famously known to his many followers as Maharaji.

414
00:45:45,599 --> 00:46:01,599
When he returned that fall, Friedland had taken a spiritual name and walked around in sandals and flowing Indian robes, He had a room off campus, above a garage, and Jobs would go there many afternoons to seek him out.

415
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:10,799
He was entranced by the apparent intensity of Friedland's conviction that a state of enlightenment truly existed and could be attained.

416
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:15,440
He turned me on to a different level of consciousness, Jobs said.

417
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:19,340
Friedland found Jobs fascinating as well.

418
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,800
He was always walking around barefoot, he later told a reporter.

419
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,460
The thing that struck me was his intensity.

420
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,719
Whatever he was interested in, he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.

421
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,840
Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people.

422
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,119
One of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to.

423
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:51,039
He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.

424
00:46:52,650 --> 00:47:01,219
According to Kotke, some of Jobs' personality traits, including a few that lasted throughout his career, were borrowed from Friedland.

425
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:07,099
Friedland taught Steve the reality distortion field, said Kotke.

426
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:14,159
He was charismatic and a bit of a con man and could bend situations to his very strong will.

427
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,259
He was mercurial, sure of himself, a little dictatorial.

428
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:25,679
like that after spending time with Robert.

429
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,720
Jobs also absorbed how Friedland made himself the center of attention.

430
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,460
Robert was very much an outgoing, charismatic guy, a real salesman, Kotke recalled.

431
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,820
When I first met Steve, he was shy and self-effacing, a very private guy.

432
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:51,200
I think Robert taught him a lot about selling, about coming out of his shell, of opening up and taking charge of a situation.

433
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,019
Friedland projected a high wattage aura.

434
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:03,299
"'Walk into a room and you would instantly notice him.' Steve was the absolute opposite when he came to read.

435
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:07,619
After he spent time with Robert, some of it started to rub off.

436
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:17,380
On Sunday evenings, Jobs and Friedland would go to the Hare Krishna temple on the western edge of Portland, often with Kotki and Holmes in tow.

437
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,119
They would dance and sing songs at the top of their lungs.

438
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,820
We would work ourselves into an ecstatic frenzy, Holmes recalled.

439
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,440
Robert would go insane and dance like crazy.

440
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,000
Steve was more subdued, as if he was embarrassed to let loose.

441
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:39,519
Then they would be treated to paper plates piled high with vegetarian food.

442
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:52,719
Friedland had stewardship of a 220-acre apple farm about 40 miles southwest of Portland that was owned by an eccentric millionaire uncle from Switzerland named Marcel Mueller.

443
00:48:54,219 --> 00:49:07,849
After Friedland became involved with Eastern spirituality, he turned it into a commune called the All One Farm, and Jobs would spend weekends there with Kotke, Holmes, and like-minded seekers of Enlightenment.

444
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:15,929
The farm had a main house, a large barn, and a garden shed where Kotke and Holmes slept.

445
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:21,179
Jobs took on the task of pruning the Gravenstein apple trees.

446
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:27,779
We were in the organic cider business.

447
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:34,280
Steve's job was to lead a crew of freaks to prune the orchard and whip it back into shape.

448
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:45,480
Monks and disciples from the Hare Krishna temple would come and prepare vegetarian feasts, redolent with cumin, coriander, and turmeric.

449
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,119
Steve would be starving when he arrived, and he would stuff himself, Holmes recalled.

450
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,559
Then he would go and purge.

451
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,919
For years I thought he was bulimic.

452
00:49:55,919 --> 00:50:03,339
It was very upsetting, because we had gone to all that trouble of creating these feasts, and he couldn't hold it down.

453
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:10,220
Jobs was also beginning to have a little trouble stomaching Friedland's cult leader style.

454
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:15,559
Perhaps he saw a little bit too much of Robert in himself, said Kotke.

455
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:23,340
Although the commune was supposed to be a refuge from materialism, Friedland began operating it more as a business.

456
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:34,640
His followers were told to chop and sell firewood, make apple presses and wood stoves, and engage in other commercial endeavors for which they were not paid.

457
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:44,599
One night Jobs slept under the table in the kitchen and was amused to notice that people kept coming in and stealing each other's food from the refrigerator.

458
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:47,760
Communal economics were not for him.

459
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,820
It started to get very materialistic, Jobs recalled.

460
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:59,119
Everybody got the idea they were working very hard for Robert's farm, and one by one they started to leave.

461
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,960
I got pretty sick of it.

462
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:13,199
Many years later, after Friedland had become a billionaire copper and gold mining executive, working out of Vancouver, Singapore, and Mongolia, I met him for drinks in New York.

463
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,940
That evening I emailed Jobs and mentioned my encounter.

464
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:22,559
He telephoned me from California within an hour and warned me against listening to Friedland.

465
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:36,039
He said that when Friedland was in trouble because of environmental abuses committed by some of his mines, He had tried to contact Jobs to intervene with Bill Clinton, but Jobs had not responded.

466
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:45,900
Robert always portrayed himself as a spiritual person, but he crossed the line from being charismatic to being a con man, Jobs said.

467
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:55,280
It was a strange thing to have one of the spiritual people in your young life turn out to be, symbolically, and in reality, a gold miner.

468
00:51:59,239 --> 00:51:59,900
Drop out.

469
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,259
Jobs quickly became bored with college.

470
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:08,519
He liked being at Reed, just not taking the required classes.

471
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:16,019
In fact, he was surprised when he found out that for all of its hippie aura, there were strict course requirements.

472
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:24,139
When Wozniak came to visit, Jobs waved his schedule at him and complained, they are making me take all these courses.

473
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:28,819
Woz replied, yes, that's what they do in college.

474
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:40,519
Jobs refused to go to the classes he was assigned and instead went to the ones he wanted, such as a dance class where he could enjoy both the creativity and the chance to meet girls.

475
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:45,139
I would never have refused to take the courses you were supposed to.

476
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:49,360
That's a difference in our personality, Wozniak marveled.

477
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:59,039
Jobs also began to feel guilty, he later said, about spending so much of his parents' money on an education that did not seem worthwhile.

478
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:08,579
All of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition, he recounted in a famous commencement address at Stanford.

479
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:16,159
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

480
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,819
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

481
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:26,799
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.

482
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,739
He didn't actually want to leave Reed.

483
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,440
He just wanted to quit paying tuition and taking classes that didn't interest him.

484
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,119
Remarkably, Reed tolerated that.

485
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:46,579
He had a very inquiring mind that was enormously attractive, said the Dean of Students, Jack Dudman.

486
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:54,180
He refused to accept automatically received truths, and he wanted to examine everything himself.

487
00:53:55,329 --> 00:54:01,940
Dudman allowed Jobs to audit classes and stay with friends in the dorms even after he stopped paying tuition.

488
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:12,519
The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting, he said.

489
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:20,780
Among them was a calligraphy class that appealed to him after he saw posters on campus that were beautifully drawn.

490
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:32,780
I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great topography great.

491
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:40,940
It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

492
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:49,559
It was yet another example of Jobs consciously positioning himself at the intersection of the arts and technology.

493
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:58,519
In all of his products, technology would be married to great design, elegance, human touches, and even romance.

494
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:03,639
He would be in the fore of pushing friendly graphical user interfaces.

495
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:07,980
The calligraphy course would become iconic in that regard.

496
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:17,760
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

497
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:24,019
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

498
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:31,039
In the meantime, Jobs eked out a bohemian existence on the fringes of Reed.

499
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,679
He went barefoot most of the time, wearing sandals when it snowed.

500
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,339
Elizabeth Holmes made meals for him, trying to keep up with his obsessive diets.

501
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:55,179
He returned soda bottles for spare change, continued his treks to the free Sunday dinners at the Hare Krishna temple, and wore a down jacket in the heatless garage apartment he rented for $20 a month.

502
00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:05,559
When he needed money... He found work at the psychology department lab maintaining the electronic equipment that was used for animal behavior experiments.

503
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:09,139
Occasionally, Chrisanne Brennan would come to visit.

504
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:18,819
Their relationships sputtered along erratically, but mostly he tended to the stirrings of his own soul and personal quest for enlightenment.

505
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,599
I came of age at a magical time, he reflected later.

506
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,519
Our consciousness was raised by Zen and also by LSD.

507
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:34,360
Even later in life, he would credit psychedelic drugs for making him more enlightened.

508
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:40,740
Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life.

509
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:48,980
LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin, and you can't remember it when it wears off, but you know it.

510
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:55,700
It reinforced my sense of what was important, creating great things instead of making money.

511
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,980
putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.

512
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,090
Chapter 4.

513
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:29,420
Atari and India Zen and the Art of Game Design In February 1974, after 18 months of hanging around Reed, Jobs decided to move back to his parents' home in Los Altos and look for a job.

514
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,650
It was not a difficult search.

515
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:41,920
At peak times during the 1970s, the classified section of the San Jose Mercury carried up to 60 pages of technology help wanted ads.

516
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,699
One of those caught Jobs' eye.

517
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,079
Have fun, make money, it said.

518
00:57:48,450 --> 00:58:01,660
That day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and told the personnel director, who was startled by his unkempt hair and attire, that he wouldn't leave until they gave him a job.

519
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:16,380
Atari's founder was a burly entrepreneur named Nolan Bushnell, who was a charismatic visionary with a nice touch of showmanship in him, in other words, another role model waiting to be emulated.

520
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:24,660
After he became famous, he liked driving around in a rolls, smoking dope, and holding staff meetings in a hot tub.

521
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:39,139
As Friedland had done, and as Jobs would learn to do, he was able to turn charm into a cunning force, to cajole and intimidate and distort reality with the power of his personality.

522
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:51,440
His chief engineer was Al Alcorn, beefy and jovial and a bit more grounded, the house grown-up trying to implement the vision and curb the enthusiasms of Bushnell.

523
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,019
Their big hit thus far was a video game called Pong.

524
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:02,619
in which two players tried to volley a blip on a screen with two movable lines that acted as paddles.

525
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:05,860
If you're under 30, ask your parents.

526
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:13,699
When Jobs arrived in the Atari lobby wearing sandals and demanding a job, Alcorn was the one who was summoned.

527
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,849
I was told, we've got a hippie kid in the lobby.

528
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,559
He says he's not going to leave until we hire him.

529
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,949
Should we call the cops or let him in?

530
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:24,420
I said, bring him on in.

531
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:33,219
Jobs thus became one of the first 50 employees at Atari working as a technician for $5 an hour.

532
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,119
In retrospect, it was weird to hire a dropout from Reed, Alcorn recalled.

533
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,240
but I saw something in him.

534
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,740
He was very intelligent, enthusiastic, excited about tech.

535
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:51,380
Alcorn assigned him to work with a straight-laced engineer named Don Lang.

536
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,720
The next day, Lang complained.

537
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:59,040
This guy's a goddamn hippie with B.O. Why did you do this to me?

538
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,440
And he's impossible to deal with.

539
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:10,400
Jobs clung to the belief that his fruit-heavy, vegetarian diet would prevent not just mucus, but also body odor.

540
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,059
even if he didn't use deodorant or shower regularly.

541
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:16,320
It was a flawed theory.

542
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:22,280
Lang and others wanted to let Jobs go, but Bushnell worked out a solution.

543
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,320
The smell and behavior wasn't an issue with me, he said.

544
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,699
Steve was prickly, but I kind of liked him, so I asked him to go on the night shift.

545
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:33,760
It was a way to save him.

546
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,219
Jobs would come in after Lang and others had left and work through most of the night.

547
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:43,199
Even thus isolated, he became known for his brashness.

548
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,980
On those occasions when he happened to interact with others, he was prone to informing them that they were dumb shits.

549
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,500
In retrospect, he stands by that judgment.

550
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:59,720
The only reason I shone was that everyone else was so bad, Jobs recalled.

551
01:01:01,219 --> 01:01:06,539
Despite his arrogance, or perhaps because of it, he was able to charm Atari's boss.

552
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:11,519
He was more philosophical than the other people I worked with, Bushnell recalled.

553
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,239
We used to discuss free will versus determinism.

554
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,940
I tended to believe that things were much more determined, that we were programmed.

555
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,919
If we had perfect information, we could predict people's actions.

556
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:27,099
Steve felt the opposite.

557
01:01:28,009 --> 01:01:33,679
that outlook accorded with his faith in the power of the will to bend reality.

558
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:44,720
Jobs helped improve some of the games by pushing the chips to produce fun designs, and Bushnell's inspiring willingness to play by his own rules rubbed off on him.

559
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,360
In addition, he intuitively appreciated the simplicity of Atari's games.

560
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:57,640
They came with no manual and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman could figure them out.

561
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,460
The only instructions for Atari's Star Trek game were 1.

562
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,440
Insert quarter Two, avoid Klingons.

563
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,340
Not all of his co-workers shunned Jobs.

564
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:18,159
He became friends with Ron Wayne, a draftsman at Atari, who had earlier started a company that built slot machines.

565
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:26,019
It subsequently failed, but Jobs became fascinated with the idea that it was possible to start your own company.

566
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:29,139
Ron was an amazing guy, said Jobs.

567
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:30,860
He started companies.

568
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,019
I had never met anybody like that.

569
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:36,779
He proposed to Wayne that they go into business together.

570
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:43,119
Job said he could borrow $50,000 and they could design and market a slot machine.

571
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,200
But Wayne had already been burned in business, so he declined.

572
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:56,900
I said that was the quickest way to lose $50,000, Wayne recalled, but I admired the fact that he had a burning drive to start his own business.
